## Overview

Second Brain is a powerful AI-powered knowledge management application designed to help users store and retrieve their daily memories efficiently. By leveraging **Llama AI** and **MongoDB Atlas vector search**, the app allows users to save information as structured cards and instantly retrieve relevant documents based on contextual search.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: Uses Llama AI and MongoDB Atlas vector search to provide intelligent and context-aware search results.
- **Memory Storage**: Allows users to save daily thoughts, notes, or important information in a structured card-based format.
- **Seamless Retrieval**: Enables quick access to relevant documents and memories using AI-powered search queries.
- **MERN Stack Implementation**: Built using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS for a robust and scalable architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search**: For efficient and accurate retrieval of stored memories.
- **Llama AI**: Enhancing search capabilities with advanced AI-based natural language processing.
- **ReactJS & NodeJS**: For front-end and back-end development.
- **Netlify**: For seamless deployment and hosting.
- **GoogleCloud** : For creating a CI/CD pipeline for application using cloud build and cloud run

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the major challenges was optimizing the vector search algorithm to ensure fast and accurate retrieval of user data. Implementing efficient indexing strategies and handling large datasets were key aspects of the project. Additionally, integrating Llama AI to refine search accuracy significantly improved the user experience.
Deploying the app in a scalable way using cloud build.

## Outcome

Second Brain has transformed the way users store and retrieve information, making knowledge management more intuitive and efficient. By combining AI with a robust MERN stack architecture, the application enhances productivity and ensures easy access to stored memories.
